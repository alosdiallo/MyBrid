MyBrid: Visualizing and managing enhanced yeast hybrid screens
Visualizing and managing enhanced yeast hybrid screens.

     A major challenge in systems biology is to understand the gene regulatory networks that drive development, physiology and pathology. The first level of gene control involves sequence-specific transcription factors (TFs) that function through various types of physical interactions. These include interactions with regulatory regions of the genome (like promoters and enhancers), and also interactions with regulatory proteins (like co-factors and other TFs). 

     We detect TF-DNA interactions using yeast one-hybrid (Y1H) assays and TF-protein interactions using yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) assays. To delineate genome-scale regulatory networks, large sets of interactions need to be interrogated at high throughput and high coverage. To achieve this, we developed enhanced Y1H and Y2H assays that use a robotic mating platform with a set of improved reagents and automated readout quantification software called SpotOn. The pipeline for enhanced Y1H assays is presented in the figure at the right. 

     MyBrid was developed for several tasks linked to these enhanced yeast hybrid assays: 1) to upload and view assay images that have been processed by SpotOn; 2) to correct (rare) miscalls by SpotOn; and 3) to download interaction datasets. Mybrid is also an access point for all of the Walhout lab papers.
